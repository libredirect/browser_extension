## Data collected
* LibRedirect does not collect any Personal Information of any kind.
* LibRedirect doesn't embed any kind of analytics in its code.
* All aspects of the extension work locally in your browser, with the exception of 
OpenStreetMap (OSM) reverse geocoding, done via the [OSM Nomantim API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/), 
used as part of OSM redirects, which can be disabled by toggling the OSM redirects.
* It also connects to [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libredirect/libredirect/master/src/instances/data.json) to update the Instances List. Though this only gets triggered when the user presses the `Update Instances` button.
* For bibliogram instances. To set a cookie you should send an http request to the server as the server stores settings values itself and gives you a token to access them.
